# django url\_utils #
is a django application with some url helper functionality.

Currently it provides a template tag to generate a project specific url/permalink for a model. This can be used instead of the models `get_absolute_url` method. When reusing django apps the `get_absolute_url` method might not generate the urls you would like to use in your project.
